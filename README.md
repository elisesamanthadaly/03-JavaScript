# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This is a random password generator. Users can select desired password length and any combination of four possible character sets (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters) to include in the password.

You can find the password generator [here](https://elisesamanthadaly.github.io/2-13-21-Homework/).


## Usage

Click the red "Generate Password" button at the center of the screen to begin.

Input a desired password length between 8 and 128, using numeric characters ("8" instead of "eight").

Choose which of the four possible character sets to include in the password. At least one set must be chosen.

The randomized password will replace the text "Your Secure Password."

New passwords can be generated in succession.
